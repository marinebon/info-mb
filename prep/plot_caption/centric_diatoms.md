Centric diatoms are often thought of as signature or "keystone" phytoplankton species within upwelling systems. Centrics were abundant from 1998-2002, but in spring 2003 became less so. Several months following the centric decrease, dinoflagellates bloomed instead and their numbers remain high. Overall phytoplankton biomass remained high, but the dominant taxa changed, and must have affected fish and other higher-trophic level organisms in as yet unexplored ways.
