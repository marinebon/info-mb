Centric diatoms are often thought of as signature or "keystone" phytoplankton species within upwelling systems. Centric diatoms dominate under high nutrients and external energy input. As upwelling weakens and nutrients decrease, pennate diatoms become important. Dinoflagellates are more abundant in stratified waters where turbulence is weak. Under unusual conditions of high nutrient availability and strong stratification, toxic red tides, can develop.
