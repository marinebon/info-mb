In 2003, dinoflagellates replaced diatoms as the dominant phytoplankton taxon in Monterey Bay. This shift in "keystone" phytoplankon is associated with an increase in near surface stratification and a decrease in upwelling-favorable winds. Some species of dinoflagellates are known to produce toxic phytoplankton blooms known as "red tide".
