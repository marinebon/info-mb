Under the auspices of the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON), MBARI, Stanford and USF researchers are using eDNA to assess biodiversity in the MBNMS. The U.S. MBON projects are funded under the National Ocean Partnership Program (NOPP RFP NOAA-NOS-IOOS-2014-2003803) in partnership between NOAA, BOEM, and NASA, with the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (U.S. IOOS) program pioneering the implementation. Seawater is collect from CTD bottles at various locations and depths. http://www.marinebon.org/genomics.html
