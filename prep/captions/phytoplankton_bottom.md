<p>Some of the first principles in biological oceanography are that phytoplankton primary production supports the pelagic and benthic ecosystems and determines the rate of accumulation of organic material in the sediments. The so-called biological “pump” moves the energy harvested from sunlight by phytoplankton to the deep ocean. Phytoplankton, because they exist at the ocean-atmosphere interface, are directly affected by changes in climate.
