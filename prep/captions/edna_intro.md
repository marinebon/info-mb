Using seawater collected in the MBNMS, environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is used to evaluate biodiversity.  eDNA sequence reads can be used as a qualitative and quantitative proxy for marine assemblages in a variety of oceanic habitats. Metabarcoding is a method of DNA barcoding that uses sections of DNA sequences as targets to identify DNA from a mixture of organisms.
