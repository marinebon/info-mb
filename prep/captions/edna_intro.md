Using seawater collected in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS), DNA associated with the environment is used to evaluate biodiversity. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is the DNA suspended in seawater originating from tissue, cells, or extracellular DNA and can be sequenced to get a qualitative proxy for marine assemblages in a variety of oceanic habitats. Metabarcoding is a method of DNA barcoding that uses sections of DNA sequences as targets to identify DNA from a mixture of organisms.
